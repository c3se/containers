# NAMD

Built from Nvidia NGC repository.

NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD uses the popular molecular graphics program VMD for simulation setup and trajectory analysis, but is also compatible with AMBER, CHARMM, and X-PLOR.

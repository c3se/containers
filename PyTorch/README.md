This directory includes containers build for PyTorch.

There are two main sources for these images:
 - PyTorch official images from [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pytorch/pytorch)
 - Nvidia optimized images from the [NGC catalog](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch/tags)

 You can read more about the NGC containers at
 <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/pytorch-release-notes/index.html>.

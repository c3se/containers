# Using container-based solutions on C3SE clusters 
Container technology has a number of advantages over the traditional workflow of using scientific software. The singularity flavour, in particular, targets reproducibility, performance and security with respect to running software in an HPC environment. Here, we provide our containerized solutions at C3SE. For each of the provided containers, read the specific instructions in the corresponding folder to easily get started with using them in your workflow. The actual container images are hosted on Singularity Hub. Click on the badge above to quickly get access to them!

## Missing containers, updates, and troubleshooting
We continuously add more packages to this repository. If you can't find a relevant container for your needs, or in the case of encountering any errors or deprecated features in the material, feel free to contact us: <support@c3se.chalmers.se> or open a pull-request.

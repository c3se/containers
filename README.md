# Container recipes provided at C3SE clusters 
This repository holds the recipes of the centrally provided Apptainer containers at C3SE's clusters.
They are also useable as a reference for users who wish to build their own Apptainer singularity containers.

For instructions see <https://www.c3se.chalmers.se/documentation/miscellaneous/containers/>

## Missing containers, updates, and troubleshootin
We continuously add more packages to this repository. If you can't find a relevant container for your needs, or in the case of encountering any errors or deprecated features in the material, feel free to contact us through <https://supr.naiss.se/support/> or open a pull-request.
